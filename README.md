## Issues with the Spotify API

There may be some issues with Spotify API, we are listing few that we know

1. Seek bar won’t update until paused as we required the data coming from the player instance using “/me/player” end-point. This was working but recently has been reported broken by community. ([Link to the article](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Spotify-for-Developers/currently-playing-returning-incorrect-progress-ms/td-p/5380840))
